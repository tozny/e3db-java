 * Holds information about any error that occurred during an asynchronous operation.

 * <p>This class holds can hold one of two different types of errors: E3DB-specific errors, or
 * something else. In the first case, the {@link #error()} method will return a non-{@code null} value
 * (representing a specific E3DB error); in the second, {@link #error()} will return {@code null}, and
 * you should use {@link #other()} to get the specific exception that occurred.
 *
 * <p><b>Note</b>: You should never need to use {@code instanceof} to test that a {@link Result} instance has this class &mdash; the
 * {@link Result#isError()} and {@link Result#asError()} methods work together to do the same.
 *
 * @param <R> The type of value returned when an operation completes successfully. Only present because
 *           the interface requires it.
